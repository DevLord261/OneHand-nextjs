## Getting Started

In Order to Start working and testing the project you need to run the  [OneHand Springboot backend](https://github.com/DevLord261/OneHand-Springboot.git) and configure the DataSource to connect to your localdatabse and setup the api_URL in the .env variables

Note: in this version i am still using static link to fetch from frontend so .env not working right now
